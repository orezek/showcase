# My Personal Page

Welcome to the repository for my personal page! This project is currently a basic HTML page, but I plan to add more 
features over time.

## Project Description

This project serves as my personal page where I will showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. As of now, the page 
is implemented using basic HTML. However, I plan to gradually enhance it by adding more features and technologies.

## Future Improvements

Here are some of the features and improvements I plan to implement in the future:

- Deploy the page to one of the public cloud providers.
- Adding a CSS stylesheet for better design and user experience.
- Implementing JavaScript for dynamic content.

- Including a portfolio section to showcase my projects.
